# Milestone Overview
## Summary of Work Accomplished During this Period

###### IOC

###### Robot Simulator/Monitor

###### Routing

###### Android App
At the time of the presentation for Progress Report 1 the UI for the Android app had been created, as well as the ability to navigate between all the different pages. Since then, a majority of the backend programming has been completed for the Android app. The authentication system has been implemented so that the maintenance crews are able to login into the system. Users will be taken back to the login page to re-enter their information if their credentials are incorrect. Once having logged into the system, the crew member is taken to the main page where functionality has been implemented to welcome them according to their ID, as well as shown the next robot that they will be maintaining. The navigational screen now directly opens the Google Maps app on the user's device, instead of showing a map that requires extra work to navigate the user. Finally, work has also been completed to send the user's location to the SensorUp server every 5 seconds.

In order to handle login authentication as well as general network requests, we researched and used the Volley API. Volley is a library used in Android apps that allows users to send HTTP network requests such as POST, GET, and PATCH requests. These requests are sent asynchronously, which means blah blah. Authentication in the Android app is handled through this library. One change that was implemented into the login screen was to have the user specify an IP address. This IP address value is taken in the app and then used by Volley to connect to a server, where a PHP file connects to a database of users. The database queries the username and password that the user has entered and if there is a match, the user is taken to the main page of the Android app. If the connection to the server and authentication succeeds, the server sends back a crew ID, as well as the next robot on their route to be used for several purposes that will be expanded upon in later paragraphs. If there is an issue with the database authentication, the user is informed that the credentials they have entered are incorrect, and to try again.
